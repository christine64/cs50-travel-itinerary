This app is scaffolded using both Django Python for backend and Create-React-App for the front end

# Running the front end
To open the app, you must first `cd client` to the front end app and install dependencies using npm.

# Install Dependencies
`npm i`

# Install Dependencies
`npm run start`

This will start up the app on localhost:3000, and you should be able to see the front end development build.
